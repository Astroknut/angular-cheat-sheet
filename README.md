# Observables && Promises

## promise
A Promise handles a single event when an async operation completes or fails. It is used in preference to callback functions in writing synchronus code. It returns a single value and is not cancellable. 

### syntax / methods
* new Promise(resolve, reject) => {}
* toPromise();
* then();
* pending
* fulfilled
* resolve
* rejected


## observable
An Observable is like a Stream and allows you to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event. It is cancellable. Uses Reactive Extensions (RxJS). Preferred over promises for Http requests. 



### syntax
* Observable provides operators like map, forEach, reduce, similar to an array
* subscribe
* unsubscribe

SERVICES!

WHAT IS IT?
An Angular 2 service is simply a javascript function, along with its associated properties and methods, that can be included (via dependency injection) into Angular 2 components.

INJECTION?

INJECTABLE SERVICES:
The @Injectable() decorator tells TypeScript to emit metadata about the service. The metadata specifies that Angular may need to inject other dependencies into this service.

Code Example:
@Injectable()
export class NameService {
}



NAMING CONVENTION:
The naming convention for service files is the service name in lowercase followed by .service. For a multi-word service name, use lower dash-case. For example, the filename for SpecialSuperHeroService is special-super-hero.service.ts.
