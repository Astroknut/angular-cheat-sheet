#Components

A component controls a patch of screen called a view.
You define a components application logic inside a class. The class interacts with the view through an API of properties and methods. 

Properties can return data through imported services.
Methods will set properties based on user input. 


Components are created, updated, and destoryed as a user moves through the application. The app takes action at each moment in its lifecycle through optional lifecycle hooks(ex. ngOnInit()).
